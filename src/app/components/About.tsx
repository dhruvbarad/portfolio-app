                    I am a dedicated and passionate graduate of the University of Minnesota with a Bachelor of Science
                    in Computer Science. With a solid foundation in various programming languages, frameworks, and
                    development methodologies, I have developed a diverse skill set that I actively apply
                    professionally. My educational background and professional experience in software development equip
                    me with a strong set of skills and knowledge. I am eager to continue applying and expanding these
                    abilities professionally, contributing to innovative projects, and collaborating with talented
                    teams.
